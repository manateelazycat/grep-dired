;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Grep filename in dired.
;;
;; This extension is fork find-dired.el
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put grep-dired.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'grep-dired)
;;
;; No need more.

;;; Customize:
;;
;;
;;
;; All of the above can customize by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET grep-dired RET
;;

;;; Change log:
;;
;; 2018/10/12
;;      * First released.

This is a cons of two strings (FIND-OPTION . LS-SWITCHES).
FIND-OPTION is the option (or options) passed to `find' to produce
a file listing in the desired format.  LS-SWITCHES is a set of
`ls' switches that tell dired how to parse the output of `find'.

The two options must be set to compatible values.
For example, to use human-readable file sizes with GNU ls:
   (\"-exec ls -ldh {} +\" . \"-ldh\")

To use GNU find's inbuilt \"-ls\" option to list files:
   (\"-ls\" . \"-dilsb\")
since GNU find's output has the same format as using GNU ls with
the options \"-dilsb\"."
